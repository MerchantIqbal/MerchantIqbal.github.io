1. Think about how the various authors in the readings so far make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced.Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not.
What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Authors of digital history make arguments in multiple different ways. Authors can write blogs or papers and format them into digital material. They can create visual or auditory features for their audience to experience. Authors can make an argument as early as when they decide what material they use and what they leave out of their history. Robertson and Mullen suggest that "[i]n selecting (and excluding) material, a historian makes an argument about what sources are important for understanding a topic."[^1] However what seems to be missing is the use of tactile material to further argue a point. The issue with digital history is that since it is digital it lacks certain senses, such as smell and touch.  

2. What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This process allows us to converse with the raw data that other classes only hint at. When other classes assign readings, the readings will have an analysed form of the data which can hinder your own conclusions that one may draw from the data. Additionally, understanding how authors find and analyse their data allows one the ability to better percieve the biases that may be within a written work. For example, now that I have learned about the use of OpenRefine to clean data and merge clusters, I could see how it might lead to misinterpreting the data. In the case of names, multiple people can have the same name, Tom Jones is a very common name and data could be invalid if it is assumed that all Tom Jones are the same person, even if the time period is narrow.

3. How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Digital works allow for more creative freedom. This freedom allows a person to argue their point in a manner that will be most effective for him or her self and for the audience he or she wishes to convince. Digital work also allows authors to attempt to make arguments using non-conventional material. For example, the use of digital software allows us to better analyse and present oral history to an audience. Oral hisotyr has been until recently a less trusted form of history and one that was viewed as incapable of being a reliable form of history. Now that we can record, transcribe, and analyse oral history, it can be used more wide spread to better understand history that was originally kept orally. 

4. How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To understand digital history, a person must be able to appreciate the medium that the history is being displayed through. Assuming that the digital history in question is a website, if a person does not have a computer, internet, or electricity, they will be unable to ascess the display and therefore be unable to appreciate the arguement being put forth. Additionally, if a person is unable to to intereact with the display as intended due to diablitiy or ignorance, they will not be able to appreciate the argument of the author. Looking at the authors from this week's readings, we can see that each ahas their own way of displaying their argument. Some use videos[^2], some use text, some use phography or a combination of the previous together to make their argument.[^3] Still others use interactive displays that can be manipulated by the viewer to better understand the information being presented.[^4] If a person is unable to appreciate the medium through which they are experiencing the history, they will be unable to understand the argument being made.
