After some back and forth I ended up looking at cases from Old Bailey court in England. Due to issues with xml, RScript, and Jupyter Notebook, I concluded that the best way to create any sort of findings would be to manually create a `.csv` table. I used the API demonstrater to find cases between 1675 and 1677 that had female defendants. In doing this I was given 1008 results and a list of ten xml files which were at the top. I took those ten and created a `.csv` table of the ten case reports.

# CSV Table

# Discussion
Through OpenRefine, I cleaned and formated the `.csv` file and then opened the resulting `.csv` in Excel. using excel I was able to create the above graphs.
