<strong> Drawing on what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital history’ might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kinds of ‘digital silences’ did you encounter? What has excited you? Finally, where do you want to go, with digital history?</strong>

### Reflection 1: Going Further Sequence
-----------------------------------------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believed Digital History to be a study of the rise of the digital era and the key technology that brought about our current period and the issues that face society today due to the digital world. Now I see that I was incorrect. This course seems to instead discuss the ways in which we use technology to store, distribute, and learn about history. Kimberley Martin discusses in the beginning of her article, _Clio, Rewired: Propositions for the Future of Digital History Pedagogy in Canada_, about the comfort level historians have with digital technology and its use in their work. The historians who answered suggested that their work was to varying degrees digital in nature. This means that a lot of historical study is digital, whether we realise it or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin also goes on to describe the different methods that history interacts with the digital world and how we use technology to facilitate the storage, dissemination, and teaching of history. I did not even realise some of the ways I too use technology for my academics. I of course use technology to find resources, for example, the online databases, search engines, and programs such as **Zotero** to store and organise my research for my essays. However, I did not realise that something as irrelevent as keeping some of my work on a website I use as an online CV would be considered a part of digital history. Within the website, I keep some of my better essays, as well as writing samples that more creative, such as articles and stories I have written. I use **WordPress** to create my website. I found that **WordPress** was really customizable at one time, however, as it is becoming more user friendly, it is becoming less HTML friendly and therefore the ability to customize has become more difficult. I am hoping to look into **Static Websites** as a more unique form of storage solutiuon for my essays and other written work.
