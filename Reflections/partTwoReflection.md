1. Who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Academic work is usually paid for by educational institutions, such as universities and colleges, governments, historical institutions, such as museums, and political institutions, such as political parties. Those interested in historical work will usually pay historians to create works that describe and analyse the history they are studying.

2. What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Institutions who fund historical work will have biases. Some institutions are looking to create propaganda based on historic events or beliefs. An example of an institution that uses history for propaganda is the Daughters of the American Revolution. A group that *claims* on its website to be "dedicated to promoting patriotism, preserving American history and securing America's future."[^1] DAR will have a bias on the type of history it wishes to perserve, just as all institutions will have biases based on the people operating them.

3. Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Carleton University has a library that has physical material and a website that hold online material. The website also can lead a person to other places that hold material and historical work online. Additionally, the website can lead you to databases from other institutions. One database that I use often is [Project Muse](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/ "Project Muse").[^2]

4. What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As a student of a educational institution, I am given ascess to a large veriaty of databases and historical work to research and analyse. The university as deals with the other institutions and as such ascess is shared between them and Carleton. This is also true vice versa. Other institutions must have deals with Carleton to ascess its historical works and material. Institutions who do not have deals with Carleton either have pay-walls which I cannot ascess without paying, or gives ascess to the public freely. ***Note: Carleton links some of the free sites and databases so that students can find it from through their library website.***

5. What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do?

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; `Regular Historians` show their work to prove their point and describe their thought process. When the historian shows their work it is usually to show where their ideas come from and how they are developed to prove their point, usually in a written work such as a paper or a book. `Digital Historians` attempt to do the same. They just usie different methods. While a *regular historian* would quote other authors or primary material, to prove their point in writing, a digital historian uses digital methods to show how their data or material is relevant to their point. Digital historians also use ditial means to present their work and can be creative about said presentation, making it interactive if they wish. Digital history can be more ascessable, however, it can also be less accurate. An example is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page "Wikipedia"). Wikipedia allows for everyone to collaborate and complete the pages of information. This means that everyone can have free ascess to information, but that information is not always acurrate, since anyone could write anything they wanted on the site, even misinformation and biased information can be on the pages. People could also omit facts that they believe to be antagonistic. James Baker describes how he omitted data as he believed it to be unrelevant to his point, but was later corrected.[^3] Baker is the Director of Digital Humanities from the University of Southampton.[^4] He should be a credible source and yet he had issues with how he presented his data, so a website like wikipedia will definitely have inaccuracies, false statements, and biased facts. As such it is important to acknowledge where your materials and data comes from, how it was collected, and why it was collected. This will allow a person to better understand the biases involved with the material and consider said biases when they go to prove their point. 

6. Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Academically, showing one's work allows other scholars to understand how a person has reached his or her conclusions. References show where an academic has come from and how his or her thoughts were shaped. It also allows other scholars to reverse engineer the thoughts of an author and decide whether they would come to the same conclusions. Showing one's work also allows others to see if a person has considered all facts, materials, and data available. As a student, it is important to show your work to prove that your ideas are your own, and that you are considering the works of those who came before you. It is by referencing other works that we prove we are learning from previous historians and that we are either continuing to develop their ideas or challenging their conclusions. By doing this, a student proves that he or she is understanding and analysing the material. Additionally, quoting other respected and intelligent authors also suggests that you have read and understood their works, and by exstention, are yourself intelligent, even if you are not.
